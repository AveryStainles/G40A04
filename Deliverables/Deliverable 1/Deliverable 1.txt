Main question:
	- What are the modern computational techniques employed for nuclear physics engineering?



10 Questions: 
	- Section 1:
		1. What is nuclear energy?

	- Section 2:
		2. How are computations relevant to nuclear energy?
			3. How are LLM useful for nuclear research?
			4. What are LLM's limitations during nuclear energy research?
			5. How relevent is LLM to nuclear energy research as a whole?

	- Section 3:
		6. What standardizing computational techniques are out there?
			7. How are standardized computational techniques relevent?
			8. How are Monte Carlo methods used?
			9. How relevent are Monte Carlo methods?

	(Currently researching a final source, probably in the nuclear safety/evaluation softwares in place)
	- Section 4:
		10. Nuclear hysteria, how is it addressed? 
			11. How is this relevent to the field?
			12. What are the current limitations faced?
			
	- Section 5: *** Conclusion ***
