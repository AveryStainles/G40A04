- CNSC has a bunch of software models to model plant bahiour under certain conditions
- They use that to predict falure and validate designs
- CNSC: Canadian nuclear safety comission
- used in reactor liscensing and design (models used to represent plant behaviour)
- More advance models: simulations used for design and evaluation for CANDU
